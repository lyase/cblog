This is a base for all witty apps based on yahoo grids.

Basically **main.cpp** pulls in the App that pulls in the MainWindow.

The template for the main window is loaded from messages/MainWindow.xml

** CSS **

CSS is handled with the compass framework now.

you'll need to go like:

    sudo gem install compass

then from the base-app directory;

    compass compile compass

and it'll compile the CSS directly into the build directory,

or if you're working on the css change compass/config.rb line:

    output_style = :extended

rather than:

    output_style = :compressed

TODO: include compass stuff into the CMakeLists.txt stuff
